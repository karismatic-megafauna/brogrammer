## September, 2013. An Origin Story.

I was on my way to a Dodgers / Giants game in a party bus filled with
programmers who just finished a major upgrade from Rails 2 to Rails 3.

I sat next to a soon to be friend, Patrick Koperwas.

He was talking about the future of the internet, his beautiful old VW Golf
that kept breaking down and good/funny domain names.

Now, '.io' had just become a popular thing, and we thought the Juxtaposition
of Brogrammer and '.io' was hilarious. So we whipped out our Galaxy S3's
(cause they were still hot shit), and checked to see if it was available.

Patrick
> It's totally available! You gotta buy it!

Me
> No Way! How much?!?!

Patrick
> 75 Dollars. If you don't buy it, I will!

Me
> Alright I am in. What are we gonna put on it?

And that was/is the big question...what goes on Brogrammer?

So we started brainstorming and we arrived at 2 options

1. How to stay in shape while being at a computer all day
1. Parody of the Tech Industry

In the process of Brainstorming we realized that there were so many ways of
"contributing to the problem" with this particular name. The problem being
the homogeneous nature of our industry. This is the last thing we wanted to do,
so we ended up settling on making a Parody! Yay!

However, this never happened, as that takes time and effort, and Silicon Valley
came out, which was basically what we were going for, just in Blog form.

So I have basically become everything I hate about the internet. I have become
*gulp* a sqatter :(

Once the 2 year mark on the DNS registry hit, I decided I either needed to
do something with Brogrammer, or let it free.

So Here I am, trying to do something.

What the fuck does one even put on a blog?
Who wants to hear about this shit?

My mom? Yes
My grandma? Yes
My high-school journalism teacher who told me to do this when I started
college and I didn't cause I am an idiot and he is so so so wise? Yes
...
Cool, three readers.
